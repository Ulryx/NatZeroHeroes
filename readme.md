# 🎲 Nat Zero Heroes

**A bite-sized tactical roguelike where every roll could kill you.**  
Built with Unity 2D. Fueled by chaos, curses, and critical failures.

---

## 🧠 Concept

In *Nat Zero Heroes*, you command a ragtag party of unlucky adventurers.  
Each turn, you roll dice to determine your fate:

- ⚔️ Attack, defend, cast spells... if the dice allow it
- ☠️ Fumble rolls cause curses, chaos, or instant regret
- 🎴 Unlock unique heroes, dice upgrades, and passive mutations
- 🧟‍♂️ Enemies scale based on how well (or badly) you're doing

Minimal UI. Maximal tension. You’re not meant to win — you’re meant to try.
